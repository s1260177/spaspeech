# SOFA-object-for-Pure-data
SOFA-object-for-Pure-data is a graphical programming language called Pure-data that uses a Spatial Oriented Format (SOFA) file to convolve a user-specified .wav file with IR (impulse response) based on speaker azimuth and listener azimuth information.
It is an object that performs IR (impulse response) convolution according to the user-specified .wav file and speaker azimuth and listener azimuth information, and outputs the result.
With this object, you can manipulate stereophonic sound in real time within Pure-data.
It could read multiple SOFA files, but it is need to change speaker azimuth by 13 SOFA files(The speaker needs to file from 0ยบ to 180ยบ, 15ยบ each).
By default, the SOFA files are placed in the mysofa~ directory, MySOFA. If you want to use a different SOFA file, replace the contents.

How to use pdsofa~help.pd

> $ cd mysofa~

> $ make

First, select the .wav file you want to put in the sound file array.

Turn on the DSP.

Press the bang connected to [tabplay~].

Change the speaker azimuth and listener azimuth values, and the sound will be output accordingly.
