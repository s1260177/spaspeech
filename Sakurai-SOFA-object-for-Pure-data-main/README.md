# SOFA-object-for-Pure-data
SOFA-object-for-Pure-data is a graphical programming language called Pure-data that uses a Spatial Oriented Format (SOFA) file to convolve a user-specified .wav file with IR (impulse response) based on elevation azimuth and distance position information.
It is an object that performs IR (impulse response) convolution according to the user-specified .wav file and elevation azimuth and distance position information, and outputs the result.
With this object, you can manipulate stereophonic sound in real time within Pure-data.

//Sakurai adds points
I added the ability to change the azimuth of the speaker to the existing code.
The existing code could only read one SOFA file, so I made it so that it could read multiple files.
I also made it possible to change multiple SOFA files read by the slider, just as the existing code uses the slider to change the azimuth of the listener.
# Requirement

How to use pdsofa~help.pd

> $ cd mysofa~

> $ make

First, press the bung connected to the [openpanel] and select the sofafile you want to include.

Next, select the .wav file you want to put in the sound file array.

Turn on the DSP.

Press the bang connected to [tabplay~].

Change the azimuth, elevation, and distance values, and the sound will be output accordingly.

There is a video for reference.
